# nedap.components.pedestal

A Component including [Pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal) server, configuration
and a [dependency injection mechanism](https://github.com/grzm/component.pedestal).

## Rationale

* Reduce per-project boilerplate.
* The server can be delicate to configure, so changes to it should be centralized so everyone benefits from future improvements.
* Provide a mechanism for injecting Component dependencies into the request context.
  * `grzm/component.pedestal` provides that, and we build something DRYer on top of it.
